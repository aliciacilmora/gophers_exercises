# URL Shortener

## What does this do?
This URL Shortener works as similar as bit.ly, which looks at the path of incoming web request and determine if it should redirect the user to a new page or not.

For instance, if we have a redirect setup for /dogs to https://www.somesite.com/a-story-about-dogs we would look for any incoming web requests with the path /dogs and redirect them.
