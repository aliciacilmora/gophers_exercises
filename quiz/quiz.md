# What is this quiz game?
 The program will read in a quiz provided via a CSV file (more details below) and will then give the quiz to a user keeping track of how many questions they get right and how many they get incorrect. Regardless of whether the answer is correct or wrong the next question should be asked immediately afterwards. The quiz stops as soon as the time ends

 ## Flags
 * -csv -> to specify the filename of csv // default is problems.csv
 * -limit -> to specify the time limit for the quiz // default is 30 secs
